										<h1>Minnesota Transition Guide <span>for Teachers of Deaf/Hard of Hearing</span></h1>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iMI5HtsPyUc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<h2>Employment</h2>
						
					<p>One of the most important goals 
					of transition planning is preparing for future employment 
					and career opportunities. Unfortunately, people who are deaf 
					or hard of hearing experience higher rates of unemployment 
					and underemployment over a lifetime. Employment challenges, 
					usually based on communication issues, can include 
					difficulty obtaining, performing, and retaining a job, as 
					well as advancing in a career. However, much can be 
					done to help youth who are deaf or hard of hearing reach 
					their employment potential while still in middle school or 
					high school.</p>
					<p>
					Searching for a job requires an awareness of a variety of 
					occupations. At the same time, students need to explore 
					their interests, preferences, learning styles, abilities and 
					skills. Through this process, students should identify 
					specific skills they bring to the job market and other 
					skills that may need further education and training. 
					Education is an important predictor of future employment and 
					can be crucial to avoiding underemployment and attaining 
					career advancement opportunities. Today, most jobs require 
					some type of postsecondary education or training. By 
					researching a variety of career possibilities early, 
					students can begin to see the need to develop their academic 
					skills to a level necessary to access postsecondary 
					education options.</p>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GumwEIoHTEY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
					Work readiness skills are another important step along the 
					path to successful employment. These are a set of skills and 
					behaviors that are necessary for any job. Work readiness 
					skills are sometimes called soft skills, employability 
					skills, or job readiness skills. These skills include being 
					on time, dressing appropriately, communicating effectively, 
					knowing where to go when a problem arises, asking 
					appropriate questions to clarify intent, and becoming a 
					self-starter. Work readiness skills can be taught and 
					learned both in school and during work experience 
					opportunities. The Secretary’s Commission on Achieving 
					Necessary Skills (SCANS) competencies is one list of work 
					readiness skills and can be found in the Employment Teacher 
					Resources section. This list can help teachers focus on some 
					of the work readiness competencies required for all 
					employees. In addition to working on this wide range of work 
					readiness skills, teachers should provide practice 
					activities, as well as instruction, on employment 
					vocabulary, writing a resume, filling out applications and 
					writing cover and thank you letters. Students have an easier 
					time creating a resume and filling out job applications by 
					creating a complete and accurate personal information form. 
					The Teacher Resources section also contains a Personal 
					Information Sheet that can be shared with students for this 
					purpose. In addition to direct instruction, other methods 
					such as role-playing, scenarios, and simulations can be used 
					for practicing job interviews, handling demanding customers, 
					communicating with supervisors, getting along with 
					co-workers, and so forth. Work readiness skills are the 
					first step in preparing youth for high demand, high wage, 
					high skills jobs and careers and should be included in 
					transition planning with each student.</p>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G0uDUcM9UwY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
					Meaningful employment in high school is one of the most 
					essential factors in long-term employment success. Many 
					students who are D/HH have no idea about what happens in the 
					workplace or the many job occupations in any given career 
					field. Students should talk to a variety of people about 
					what they do at work and how they made their particular 
					career choice. One way for them to do this is to conduct 
					informational interview. Students also need to 
					experience the workplace. Help students participate in 
					informational interviews, job shadowing, unpaid or volunteer 
					work, or internships. Work with families, local businesses 
					and community connections to help students secure summer and 
					after-school employment. Teachers need to help youth and 
					their families see the importance of work experiences during 
					high school and set this as a priority during transition 
					planning.</p>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DBhUzNZYqhY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
					Both communication skills and access to communication are 
					critical to success in employment settings for individuals 
					who are deaf or hard of hearing. Learning communication 
					strategies that will lead to successful interactions and 
					exchanges of information with coworkers and supervisors is 
					an important skill that needs to be developed during the 
					transition years. Transition aged students should have a 
					good understanding of their hearing loss and be able to 
					explain its impact to an employer or co-workers. Other 
					communication skills include: sharing communication 
					strategies that were previously successful in other 
					settings, showing employer inexpensive options for making 
					environmental cues visible, asking school transition 
					specialist or Vocational Rehabilitation Services (VRS) 
					counselor to offer deaf awareness training for employers, 
					and knowing about and communicating workplace 
					accommodations.</p>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kVrW-jjhibI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
					Learning about workplace accommodations is essential 
					knowledge for students transitioning to the world of work. 
					Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing can be affected 
					by a number of environmental issues such as background 
					noise, visual obstructions and distractions, acoustics, 
					lighting, seating arrangements, and others. Knowing ways to 
					overcome these obstacles, learning about laws that cover 
					workers with disabilities, such as the American with 
					Disabilities Act, discussing disability disclosure and 
					determining when job accommodations are needed to complete 
					your work and communicating these ideas to supervisors are 
					all topics students need to know about before entering the 
					world of work. The Job Accommodations Network (JAN) has 
					great resources on its website, <a href="http://askjan.org">
					http://askjan.org</a>. In addition, a D/HH Workplace 
					Accommodations Checklist, which incorporates many ideas of 
					the JAN website, can be found in the Teacher Resources of 
					this document.</p>
					<p>
					Students who are deaf or hard of hearing may qualify for 
					help with employment through Minnesota’s Vocational 
					Rehabilitation Services. D/HH teachers need to be 
					familiar with these services and help students and their 
					families contact the agency for more information, or to be 
					included in transition IEP meetings. D/HH teachers may 
					want to arrange for VRS counselors to come and talk to 
					students and parents about their services as early as 
					freshman year, although most VRS referrals won’t begin 
					before junior year. Once a D/HH student has graduated 
					from high school or a school transition program, the young 
					adult may continue working with a VRS counselor in order to 
					move forward with their employment plan. For many VRS 
					clients who are D/HH, an employment goal can prepare them 
					for a competitive job with no need for ongoing worksite 
					supports. </p>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHARBjcsa5Y?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>If a D/HH student has any 
					additional disabilities and is likely to need significant, 
					permanent worksite supports beyond the first few months on 
					the job, they may require supported employment. This ongoing 
					support service is funded through counties. Qualifying for 
					these services varies greatly and is based on individual 
					needs and qualifications by each county. If you think 
					that a student may need supported employment services in 
					order to work competitively, speak to the student&#39;s IEP team 
					to consider whether that student should apply for county 
					services and/or VRS services. More information about 
					VRS is located in the <i>
					Additional Considerations</i> section of this document.</p>
